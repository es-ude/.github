Welcome to the GitHub Organisation Page of Intelligent Embedded Systems Group!

The group is working on optimization strategies for depolying embedded deep learning on heterogenous hardware platform. If you are interested on our projects, please check our [homepage](https://www.uni-due.de/es/en/en_home.php). In recent years, we established the elasticAI eco system as Open Source project for this. In order to help you to find the right tool, we try to guide you through the repos:
- You want to search an optimal model architecture for your specific problem and specific hardware platform, please check our HW-NAS [elasticAI.explorer](https://github.com/es-ude/elastic-ai.explorer).
- Train deep neural networks by considering the hardware properties and deploy the model architecture on FPGAs, please check [elasticAI.creator](https://github.com/es-ude/elastic-ai.creator).
- Emulating the signal processing pipeline from sensor to AI task (end-to-end) and build them partially for your hardware, please check [denspp.offline](https://github.com/es-ude/denspp.offline).
- You want to use the heterogenous hardware platform, please check our [elasticAI.hardware](https://github.com/es-ude/elastic-ai.hardware).
- If you want to train a deep neural network on MCUs, please check our framework for [OnDevice-Training](https://github.com/es-ude/OnDeviceTraining).
- You want to use the hardware with flashing the FPGA and add your sensor data acquistion, please check the firmware in [elasticAI.runtime](https://github.com/es-ude/elastic-ai.runtime.enV5).
- For testing/validating the deep learning model incl. pre-processing and do experiments, we provide the [elasticAI.experiment-framework](https://github.com/es-ude/elastic-ai.experiment-framework).
- If you want to test some analog filters or component using lab equipment, please have a look into [elasticAI.hw-measurements](https://github.com/es-ude/elastic-ai.hw-measurements).
